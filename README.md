UI/UX

Fully responsive design powered by Chakra UI components.

Dark/light mode support for personalized viewing.

User-friendly toast notifications for feedback (react-hot-toast).

üöÄ Installation & Setup
To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

https://github.com/popomil/build-fullstack--ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Set up your Strapi Backend:

This frontend requires a running Strapi backend. If you don't have one, you'll need to set it up separately.

Ensure your Strapi instance has:

A products collection type (with fields like name, description, price, and optionally image).

User authentication enabled (users can register and log in).

Appropriate permissions set in Strapi for public and authenticated users to access products and authentication endpoints.

Configure API Base URL:

Open the src/App.js (or src/index.js depending on your structure, but in the provided code, it's inside App.js where API_BASE_URL is defined).

Locate the API_BASE_URL constant:

const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:1337/api'; // Replace with your Strapi backend URL

Change http://localhost:1337/api to the actual URL of your Strapi backend.

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

The application should now be running in your browser, typically at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).
